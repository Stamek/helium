## What we believe

We believe in the power of community.

We believe that a community that shares knowledge, skills and experience is a strong community.

We believe that an open source approach to solving a problem results in a high-quality solution that has a higher chance of solving real world problems.

We believe that any project should enable contributors the opportunity for personal and professional development.

## The sQuorum Platform

The sQuorum project intends to build a fully decentralised open source blockchain platform that achieves the following:

* The creation of a tool for companies, educational establishments and private citizens to conduct opinion and observation-based research and reward contributors for doing so.
* The gathering of true crowd sourced opinions and observations from smartphone and computer users around the world.
* The ability to geotag data submissions, with user consent.
* The ability to create NFC tags that a contributor can scan to load a particular survey to their cell phone.
* The monetisation of gathered data in order to incentivise and reward the people who contribute it.
* The creation of a decentralised tool to provide simple probability distribution modelling in order to flag outliers and assign indicative probability scores to submitted data.
* The ability to create smart contracts that are triggered by a pre-identified outcome of a particular gathered data set.
